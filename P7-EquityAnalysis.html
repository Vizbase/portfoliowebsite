            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The integration of sentiment analysis into time series forecasting is a novel approach to enhancing financial market predictions. In this project, our goal was to improve the accuracy of European stock indices' predictions by incorporating sentiment scores derived from large language model (LLM)-generated analysis of Reuters news articles. The combination of traditional statistical models like ARIMA with AI-driven models such as PyTorch Neural Networks (NN) provided a robust framework for ...
            <h3>Data Sources and Preprocessing</h3>
            <p>The data for this project was sourced from two main components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stock Market Data</strong>: We utilized data from key European indices, including DE40 (DAX - Germany), FR40 (CAC 40 - France), NL25 (AEX - Netherlands), IT40 (FTSE MIB - Italy), SP35 (IBEX 35 - Spain), UK100 (FTSE 100 - UK), and EU50 (Euro Stoxx 50). Each dataset contained crucial market variables such as open, high, low, close prices, and volume.</li>
                <li><strong>News Sentiment Data</strong>: Sentiment data was generated by applying LLM-based sentiment analysis on Reuters news articles. Each article was scored based on its relevance to the market and its sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral). These scores were aggregated over a rolling 1-week period to capture the most recent market sentiment trends.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Data Preprocessing Steps</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stationarization</strong>: Time series models require stationary data to perform optimally. We applied differencing and normalization techniques to ensure data stationarity, minimizing the influence of trends and seasonality.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Alignment</strong>: The stock data and sentiment scores were synchronized by their timestamps to ensure a consistent and meaningful integration of sentiment data into the model inputs.</li>
                <li><strong>Normalization</strong>: All data values were normalized to ensure that different scales did not skew model predictions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sentiment Score Calculation</h3>
            <p>Sentiment analysis was a core component of this project, designed to capture market sentiment from news articles. The process involved:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Relevance Scoring</strong>: We used LLMs to determine the relevance of each news article to the market. This score helped filter out unrelated or low-impact articles.</li>
                <li><strong>Sentiment Scoring</strong>: Articles were analyzed to determine their sentiment impact, classified as positive, negative, or neutral. The sentiment score was then multiplied by the relevance score to produce a final sentiment score for each article.</li>
                <li><strong>Rolling Aggregation</strong>: The final sentiment scores were aggregated using a rolling 1-week window to provide a temporal context of market sentiment over the recent past.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Model Architecture and Implementation</h3>
            <p>We employed two main models for our analysis:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>ARIMA Model</strong>:<br> ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a well-known statistical model used for time series forecasting. It was chosen as a baseline for its robustness in capturing linear patterns in historical data. Our ARIMA implementation involved parameter tuning to find the optimal order (p, d, q) for each index. We aimed to evaluate the baseline accuracy of the model with traditional stock market data before incorporating sentiment data. While effec...
                <li><strong>PyTorch Neural Network (SimpleNN)</strong>:<br> The PyTorch NN model was designed to capture complex and non-linear relationships in the data. The architecture consisted of multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers with activation functions, to learn intricate patterns within the data. The model was trained using both the stock data alone and with the addition of sentiment scores. We evaluated the impact of sentiment data on the model's prediction accuracy. R...
            </ol>
            <h3>Model Training and Evaluation</h3>
            <p>To measure model performance, we used the following error metrics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</strong>: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.</li>
                <li><strong>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</strong>: Provides the average magnitude of errors in the predictions, offering interpretability.</li>
                <li><strong>Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)</strong>: A percentage-based error metric useful for comparing forecast accuracy across different models.</li>
                <li><strong>Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE)</strong>: Useful for comparing model performance across different datasets and timeframes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Results</h3>
            <p>The integration of sentiment data demonstrated significant potential for improving prediction accuracy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PyTorch Neural Network with Sentiment Integration</strong>: The addition of sentiment scores led to an improvement of up to 20% in prediction accuracy for select stock indices, highlighting the potential for sentiment data to capture market nuances that traditional models might overlook.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges</strong>: Not all indices showed consistent improvements. In some cases, sentiment data added noise or complexity, leading to lower accuracy. This suggests that sentiment integration must be carefully managed, with appropriate feature engineering and data preprocessing to avoid overfitting or irrelevant input data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Observations and Insights</h3>
            <p><strong>Impact of Sentiment</strong>: Our results indicate that integrating sentiment data can enhance the predictive power of AI-driven models for stock indices. However, the impact varies across different indices, reflecting the complexities of financial markets and the role of news sentiment in influencing market behavior.</p>
            <p><strong>Comparison with ARIMA</strong>: While ARIMA provided a robust baseline, its linear nature limited its ability to capture complex interactions. The PyTorch NN model, on the other hand, effectively captured non-linear trends, particularly when enriched with sentiment data.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion and Future Directions</h3>
            <p>This project highlights the potential of combining traditional statistical models with AI-driven approaches for financial forecasting. By integrating LLM-derived sentiment scores, we demonstrated the value of sentiment data in enhancing market predictions. Future work will focus on refining sentiment scoring mechanisms, exploring additional features, and testing more advanced architectures to further improve prediction accuracy and model robustness.</p>
